<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Cloud Station is not only a sophisticated cross-platform syncing software, users can use it as a smarter means of backing up their personal computers. These are some benefits of using Cloud Station as your backup companion. First of all, real-time replication provides a better RPO, a shorter period in which data might be lost (un-recoverable) from your PC due to a major incident. Not only is it instantaneous, it will also help you save bandwidth drastically, compared to traditional backup which uses up large amounts of bandwidth at a given time. You can easily filter out the files within the same folder which you don't want backed up, by setting the file size or file type on your PC client. Cloud Station can also retain up to 32 history versions of a single file which Cloud Station allows you to restore to a PC client from the server (NAS) side.</p>

<div class="code_div"><b>Note:</b> 
  QuickConnect is a relay service that allows you to easily connect to your eCore Server from outside your local network. If you want to sync your files when away from home or the office, we recommend you set up QuickConnect by going to <b>Control Panel</b> > <b>QuickConnect</b>.</div>

<li>Go to <b>Privileges</b> and specify which users will be able to use Cloud Station. Click<b> Save</b>.</li>
<img src="../../images/Backup/1x/backup_from_PC/04.png" border="1" />
<li>Set up a shared folder on your eCore Server for the purpose of backup. To do this, go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Shared Folder</strong> and click <strong>Create</strong>.</li>
<img src="../../images/Backup/1x/backup_from_PC/05.png" border="1" />
<li>Name your folder and fill in the details accordingly. Click <strong>OK</strong>. For example, we'll name the folder <strong>Backup</strong>.</li>
<img src="../../images/Backup/1x/backup_from_PC/06.png" border="1" />
<li>In the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab, specify which users will be able to access the folder. For example, we'll give <strong>admin</strong> <strong>read/write</strong> permissions to the folder. Click <strong>OK</strong>. </li>
<img src="../../images/Backup/1x/backup_from_PC/07.png" border="1" />
