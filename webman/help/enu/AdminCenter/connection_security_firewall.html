<h2><a name="leaf_firewall"></a>Firewall</h2>
<p>
Creating firewall rules at <strong>Control Panel</strong> > <strong>Security</strong> > <strong>Firewall</strong> helps prevent unauthorized login and control service access. You can decide whether to allow or deny access to certain network ports by specific IP addresses.</p><h3>To create a firewall rule:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Select a network interface from the drop-down menu in the upper right corner.</li>
<li>Click <b>Create</b>.</li>
<li>In the <b>Ports</b> section, select one of the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>Choose <b>All</b> to apply this firewall rule to all ports.</li>
<li>Choose <b>Select from a list of built-in applications</b> and click <strong>Select</strong>. Select the built-in applications you want to apply this firewall rule to.</li>
<li>Choose <b>Custom</b> and click <b>Custom</b>. Enter up to 15 ports separated by commas or specify a port range to apply this firewall rule to.</li>
</ul>
<li>In the <b>Source IP</b> section, select one of the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>Choose <b>All</b> to apply this firewall rule to all IP addresses.</li>
<li>Choose <b>Specific IP</b> and click <strong>Select</strong>. You can specify an IP addresses or IP range to apply this firewall rule to.</li>
<li>Choose <b>Region</b> and then specify up to 15 countries to apply this firewall rule to.</li>
</ul>
<li>In the <b>Action</b> section, select one of the following:</li>
<ul>
	<li>Choose <b>Allow</b> to allow access by ports and source IP addresses you have specified.</li>
	<li>Choose <b>Deny</b> to deny access by ports and source IP addresses you have specified.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<p>
You can view LAN and PPPoE firewall rules by selecting these interfaces from the box in the upper right-hand corner. At the bottom of the rule list you can select <b>Allow access</b> or <b>Deny access</b> to allow or deny any access requests that do not match an existing firewall rule for the respective interface.</p>


<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li>You can create up to 100 rules for a network interface. </li>
<li>Drag-and-drop to reorder the rules in the list.</li>
<li>Rules are prioritized according to their positions in the list.</li>
<li>If you have multiple network ports connecting to the same subnet, the firewall rules may not work properly.* </li>
<li>When you combine multiple LAN ports with link aggregation, firewall will apply the rules from the first network interface, and retain the rules of the second network interface.</li>
<li>If your DiskStation device connects to the Internet via PPPoE, the related firewall rules must be configured on the corresponding PPPoE interface.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Firewall rule behavior:</h3>
<p>DSM Firewall will match  rules according to priority. <strong>Once a rule is matched, it will be enforced and DSM Firewall will not continue matching remaining rules</strong>. If there are no rules matched, DSM Firewall will perform the default action specified in each interface.</p>
<h4>Firewall rule priority:</h4>
<ol> 
<li>Rules defined in "All interface".</li>
<li>Rules defined in respective interfaces for which the connection belongs to.</li>
<li>Default rules in respective interfaces for which the connection belongs to.</li>
</ol>
