<h1>Storage Analyzer</h1>
<p>Storage Analyzer allows you to have a quick glance at the overall usage trends of your DiskStation, create and manage tasks to analyze storage spaces, and generate detailed reports on volume usage. You can select report types, set a schedule to receive periodic storage reports, and easily view previous reports that match the specified time or criteria. With Storage Analyzer, it becomes a lot easier and more efficient to manage your system and modify your settings according to the analysis; for instance, based on its analysis reports, you can delete files rarely accessed to release space for other usage, increase quota for users with larger demand, or install more storage space to meet the need and usage trends.</p>
