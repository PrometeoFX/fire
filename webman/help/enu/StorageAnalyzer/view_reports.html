<h2>View Usage and Reports</h2>
<p>With Storage Analyzer, you can not only monitor the overall volume usage trends, but also have a glance at detailed storage analysis generated from scheduled tasks, so as to learn more about your storage space and to have better management of your DiskStation.</p>
<h3>Volume Usage</h3>
<p>In the <b>Volume Usage</b> section, you'll find a line graph displaying the volume usage trends and changes over time, or a bar chart indicating the current usage percentage if you have not enabled the volume usage history option (at <b>Report Profiles</b> > <b>Settings</b> > <b>Collect volume usage history according to a schedule</b>).</p>
<h4>To view volume usage, do any of the following:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Hover your mouse over the line in the line graph to view the used, available, and total capacity of the volume at the date indicated.</li>
<li>Click on the <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> buttons on the top-right corner to switch between two display modes (line graph and list) according to your preference. The line graph allows you to have a quick look at the overall trend over a short period of time, while the list offers the most recently collected data.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>If you have more than 10 volumes on your DiskStation, only the top ten volumes with the highest usage will be shown.</p>
</div>

<h3>Usage Reports</h3>
<p>In addition to current volume usage, you can also view various types of usage reports generated from previous tasks, or easily find the desired report that meets the specified criteria or date in just a few simple clicks. Analysis reports are classified into different types, including the quota usage of each folder or file type, and the usage of files according to their modified or accessed time.</p>


<h4>To view usage reports:</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <b>Report Profile</b> section, select a task from the profile list and then double-click the task, or simply click <b>Analyze this report task</b> (the <b>></b> icon) next to the desired task to view its collected data and analysis. (Please note tasks that have never been performed cannot be selected.)</li>
<li>Click the individual tabs on the left panel of the report page to view corresponding analysis:</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Quota Usage:</b> Displays the quota occupied by each shared folder.</li>
<li><b>User Quota:</b> Displays the file count and size owned by each user in every single shared folder.</li>
<li><b>Type:</b> Displays the quota of each file type in every single shared folder.</li>
<li><strong>Duplicates:</strong> Displays duplicated files found in the system for the convenience of organizing or deleting unnecessary copies. Please note that the greater the maximum number of duplicated files you set, the longer it will take to process.</li>
<li><b>Size:</b> Displays up to 500 files in descending order of their size.</li>
<li><b>Most Recently Modified Files:</b> Displays up to 500 files in descending order of their last modified time.</li>
<li><b>Least Recently Accessed Files:</b> Displays up to 500 files in ascending order of their last accessed time.</li>
</ul>
<li>If necessary, specify criteria from the drop-down menu to filter reports and to find the information you need more efficiently.</li>
<li>Click on any dates on the timeline slider at the bottom to view reports generated on the selected date.</li>
